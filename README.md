# ESP32_CYD
A lightweight ESP32 CYD "Cheap Yellow Display" sample project with makes usage of LVGL, the [Light and Versatile Graphics Library](https://lvgl.io) and [EEZ Studio](https://www.envox.eu/studio/studio-introduction/)

## Introduction
By accident I found the "Cheap Yellow Display" board which is one cool piece of equipment for "maker or nerd or geeks" (like myself). With this project you can make use of a nice dev environment for the CYD. I use the 2.8'' version with a resolution of 320 x 240 (ILI9341). 

Here is the result:

## Dev Environment
I used to work with the classic Arduino IDE with ESP8266 and ESP32 projects, but with this project I decided to switch finally to PlattformIO, because the Arduino IDE build times are way too long when a project gets a bit more complex...

## Build hints
My PlatformIO configuation is pretty simple. You need three external libs:

1. LVGL Version 9.0.3 for the GUI content
2. TFT_eSPI 2.5.43 from Brodmer to use the display 
3. XPT2046_Touchscreen 1.4 from Paul Stoffregen for the touch.

Here is my platformio.ini content

```
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 460800
lib_deps = 
	lvgl/lvgl@^9.3.0
	bodmer/TFT_eSPI@^2.5.43
```
**IMPORTANT**: For the touch function of the CYD you need the library XPT2046_Touchscreen  **Version 1.4** [(Click here)](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen) which **can't be found** with the PaltformIO library management. I just downloaded the stuff and used it as loacal lib in folder **/lib** which is part of this repository. 

## The /src Folder
This is the **very cool** part of the project. The only two files I wrote myself (by copying code from here and there) are these:

```
main.cpp
touchscreen.h
```

It's mainly to initialize the TFT (rotation, touch) and the serial interface in **touchscreen.h**. The definition of event handlers for Buttons etc is shown in in **main.cpp**.

## EEZ Studio

The other files were generated by the very cool tool **EEZ Studio** which generates C Code from a kind of "Form Designer" interface.

I used [EEZ Studio Version 0.24.0](https://www.envox.eu/studio/studio-introduction/) which han be downloaded [here](https://github.com/eez-open/studio/releases).

Find my EEZ Studio Project in the EEZ_STUDIO subfolder.

The generated code is LVGL compatible, so that all the source files in the following list must not be touched and can me modified by **EEZ Studio**

```
actions.h
fonts.h
images.c
images.h
screens.c
screens.h
structs.h
styles.c
styles.h
ui.c
ui.h
vars.h
```

## 3D Stuff

Finally if you are a **Maker** you might also own a 3D-printer, right? If the answer is yes and you purchased the CYD somwhere and you need some stands for your CYD just have a look here:

The CYD Stand can be used with 55° as well as 35° angle. Take your pick...

So if you like, feel free to use the STP File **ESP32_STAND_V2.stl** provided in folder **3D_PRINT** to put your CYD in a convenient position.

Note: I yust found out that Github changes .stl files. My 19kB file became a 239kB file after upload and I can't open it anymore in Cura. Therefore I added an extra .zip file with the original. 


That's it, folkes. Have fun...
